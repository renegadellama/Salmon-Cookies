      <h2 id="boutus">ABOUT US</h2>
      <p>At Salmon Cookies, we took it upon ourselves to create a product that no one was asking for, but we knew everyone would love.  </p>
      <p>The genesis of Salmon Cookies came about, as such things often do, through a combination of luck, circumstance and by pure accident.</p>
      <p>Our owner and founder, Pat, was a part time substitute drama teacher working for the King County school district when an unusual set of circumstances led to the inspiration for these pescatarian pastries.</p>
      <p>One night, during a horrific cooking accident that Pat has yet to reveal the full details about, Salmon Cookies were born! When the smoke cleared and Pat regained consciousness, he found that he had inadvertantly mixed together the ingredients for Baked Salmon and cookies. As a result of this accident, Pat may only have 45% vision in his left eye and may have lost all feeling in his toes, but today he says it was a small price to pay to bring the joy of Salmon Cookies to the world!</p>
      <p>Haven't tried one yet?  What are you waiting for!  It's literally Salmon meat baked into a cookie!  What could possibly go wrong?!</p>
